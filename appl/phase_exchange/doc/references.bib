abstract = {Correlation between microbial surface thermodynamics using the extended DLVO (XDLVO) theory and kinetic adhesion of various bacterial cells to sand was investigated. Two experimental setups were utilized. Adhesion tests were conducted in batch reactors with slow agitation. Also, bacteria were circulated through small sand columns in a closed loop and the results were analyzed with a simple model which accounted for the rate of the adhesion phenomena (omega in h(-1)) and adhesion percentage. Cells surface properties were derived from contact angle measurements. The wicking method was utilized to characterize the sand. Zeta potentials were measured for the sand and the cells. Kinetic of bacterial retention by the porous media was largely influenced by the electrostatic interactions which are correlated with omega from the model (R(2)=0.71). Negative zeta potentials resulted in electrostatic repulsions occurring between the sand and the bacterial cells which in result delayed bacterial adhesion. While no correlation was found between the adhesion percentage and the total interaction energy calculated with the XDLVO theory the respective behavior of hydrophobic and hydrophilic bacteria as well as the importance of electrostatic interactions was evidenced. All the bacterial strains studied adhered more in the column experiments than in the adhesion tests, presumably due to enhanced collision efficiency and wedging in porous media, while filtration could be ignored except for the larger Bacillus strains. Approximate XDLVO calculations due to solid surface nanoscale roughness, retention in a secondary minimum and population heterogeneity are discussed. Our results obtained with a large variety of different physicochemical bacterial strains highlights the influence of both surface thermodynamics and porous media related effects as well as the limits of using the XDLVO theory for evaluating bacterial retention through porous media.},

abstract = {A sand column leaching system with well-controlled suction and flow rate was built to investigate the effects on bacterial transport of air-water interface effects (AWI) correlated to water content, particle size, and column length. Adsorption of Escherichia coli strain D to silica sands was measured in batch tests. The average \% adsorption for coarse and fine sands was 45.9+/-7.8\% and 96.9+/-3.2\%, respectively. However, results from static batch adsorption experiments have limited applicability to dynamic bacterial transport in columns. The early breakthrough of E. coli relative to bromide was clear for all columns, namely c. 0.15 to 0.3 pore volume earlier. Column length had no significant effects on the E. coli peak concentration or on total recovery in leachate, indicating retention in the top layer of sands. Tailing of breakthrough curves was more prominent for all fine sand columns than their coarse sand counterparts. Bacterial recovery in leachate from coarse and saturated sand columns was significantly higher than from fine and unsaturated columns. Observed data were fitted by the convection-dispersion model, amended for one-site and two-site adsorption to particles, and for air-water interface (AWI) adsorption. Among all models, the two-site+AWI model achieved consistently high model efficiency for all experiments. Thus it is evident from experimental and modeling results that AWI adsorption plays an important role in E. coli transport in sand columns.},

abstract = {The adhesion of a well-characterized Escherichia coli bacterial strain to quartz sediment grains in the presence of repulsive electrostatic interactions is systematically examined. An increase in the ionic strength of the pore fluid results in an increase in bacterial attachment, despite DLVO calculations indicating a sizable electrostatic energy barrier to deposition. Bacterial deposition is likely occurring in the secondary energy minimum, which DLVO calculations indicate increases in depth with ionic strength. A decrease in the ionic strength of the pore fluid--thereby eliminating the secondary energy minimum--resulted in release of the majority of previously deposited bacteria, suggesting that these cells were deposited reversibly in the secondary minimum. Additionally, bacterial attachment to a quartz surface in a radial stagnation point flow system was absent at ionic strengths less than 0.01 M and resulted in attachment efficiencies over an order of magnitude lower than in the packed-bed column experiments at higher ionic strengths. Because of the hydrodynamics in the radial stagnation point flow system, this observation supports our conclusion that the majority of bacterial deposition in the packed bed occurs in a secondary energy minimum.},

abstract = {Owing to its widespread occurrence in drinking water supplies and its significant resistance to environmental stresses, Cryptosporidium parvum is regarded as one of the most important waterborne microbial parasites. Accordingly, a substantial research effort has been aimed at elucidating the physical, chemical and biological factors controlling the transport and removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts in natural subsurface environments and drinking water treatment facilities. In this review, a multi-scale approach is taken to discuss the current state-of-knowledge on Cryptosporidium-sand interactions at a nano-scale, bench-scale and field-scale relevant to water treatment operations. Studies conducted at the nano-scale and bench-scale illustrate how techniques based on the principles of colloid and surface chemistry are providing new insights about oocyst-sand interactions during transport of Cryptosporidium oocysts in granular porous media. Specifically, atomic force microscopy and impinging jet experiments reveal the importance of oocyst surface biomolecules in controlling Cryptosporidium/sand interactions by a mechanism of steric hindrance. Traditional bench-scale column transport studies conducted over a broad range of experimental conditions highlight the role of physicochemical filtration and physical straining in the removal of oocysts from the pore fluid. Such experiments have also been used to evaluate the influence of biofilms formed on grain surfaces and the presence of natural organic matter on oocyst-sand interactions. Whilst filtration studies conducted at the plant-scale have been useful for evaluating the effectiveness of various materials as surrogates for Cryptosporidium oocysts, at this macro-scale, little could be learnt about the fundamental mechanisms controlling oocyst-sand interactions. This review of the literature on Cryptosporidium-sand interactions at different length scales points to the importance of combining studies at the plant-scale with well-controlled investigations conducted at the nano- and bench-scales. Furthermore, because oocyst surface properties play an important role in controlling the extent of interaction with sand surfaces, a thorough discussion of Cryptosporidium oocyst characteristics and electrical properties is presented.},

abstract = {A new equation for predicting the single-collector contact efficiency (eta0) in physicochemical particle filtration in saturated porous media is presented. The correlation equation is developed assuming that the overall single-collector efficiency can be calculated as the sum of the contributions of the individual transport mechanisms--Brownian diffusion, interception, and gravitational sedimentation. To obtain the correlation equation, the dimensionless parameters governing particle deposition are regressed against the theoretical value of the single-collector efficiency over a broad range of parameter values. Rigorous numerical solution of the convective-diffusion equation with hydrodynamic interactions and universal van der Waals attractive forces fully incorporated provided the theoretical single-collector efficiencies. The resulting equation overcomes the limitations of current approaches and shows remarkable agreement with exact theoretical predictions of the single-collector efficiency over a wide range of conditions commonly encountered in natural and engineered aquatic systems. Furthermore, experimental data are in much closer agreement with predictions based on the new correlation equation compared to other available expressions.},

@article{Walker2004,
abstract = {The influence of bacterial surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on cell transport and adhesion has been examined by use of three mutants of Escherichia coli K12 with well-characterized LPS of different lengths and molecular composition. Two experimental techniques, a packed-bed column and a radial stagnation point flow system, were employed to investigate bacterial adhesion kinetics onto quartz surfaces over a wide range of solution ionic strengths. Although the two systems capture distinct deposition (adhesion) mechanisms because of their different hydrodynamics, similar deposition kinetics trends were observed for each bacterial strain. Bacterial deposition rates were directly related to the electrostatic double layer interaction between the bacteria and quartz surfaces, in qualitative agreement with classic Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. However, DLVO theory does not fully explain the deposition behavior for the bacterial strain with the lengthy, uncharged O-antigen portion of the LPS. Neither the length nor the charge characteristics of the LPS molecule directly correlated to deposition kinetics, suggesting a complex combination of cell surface charge heterogeneity and LPS composition controls the bacterial adhesive characteristics. It is further suggested that bacterial deposition behavior is determined by the combined influence of DLVO interactions, LPS-associated chemical interactions, and the hydrodynamics of the deposition system.},

abstract = {Batch cultures of Escherichia coli were grown in minimal media supplemented with various carbon sources which supported growth at specific growth rates from 0.2 to 1.3/h. The respiration rates of the cultures were measured continuously. With few exceptions, the specific rate of oxygen consumption was about 20 mmol of O2/h per g (dry weight), suggesting that the respiratory capacity was limited at this value. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) required for the production of cell material from the different carbon sources was calculated on the basis of known ATP requirements in the biochemical pathways and routes of macromolecular synthesis. The calculated ATP requirements, together with the measured growth rates and growth yields on the different carbon sources, were used to calculate the rate of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation. This rate was closely related to the respiration rate. We suggest that aerobic growth of E. coli in batch cultures is limited by the rate of respiration and the concomitant rate of ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Various abiotic and biotic processes such as sorption, dilution, and degradation are known to affect the fate of organic contaminants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons in saturated porous media. Reactive transport modeling of such plumes indicates that the biodegradation of organic pollutants is, in many cases, controlled by mixing and therefore occurs locally at the plume's fringes, where electron donors and electron-acceptors mix. Herein, we aim to test whether this hypothesis can be verified by experimental results obtained from aerobic and anaerobic degradation experiments in two-dimensional sediment microcosms. Toluene was selected as a model compound for oxidizable contaminants. The two-dimensional microcosm was filled with quartz sand and operated under controlled flow conditions simulating a contaminant plume in otherwise uncontaminated groundwater. Aerobic degradation of toluene by Pseudomonas putida mt-2 reduced a continuous 8.7 mg L(-1) toluene concentration by 35\% over a transport distance of 78 cm in 15.5 h. In comparison, under similar conditions Aromatoleum aromaticum strain EbN1 degraded 98\% of the toluene infiltrated using nitrate (68.5+/-6.2 mg L(-1)) as electron acceptor. A major part of the biodegradation activity was located at the plume fringes and the slope of the electron-acceptor gradient was steeper during periods of active biodegradation. The distribution of toluene and the significant overlap of nitrate at the plume's fringe indicate that biokinetic and/or microscale transport processes may constitute additional limiting factors. Experimental data is corroborated with results from a reactive transport model using double Monod kinetics. The outcome of the study shows that in order to simulate degradation in contaminant plumes, detailed data sets are required to test the applicability of models. These will have to deal with the incorporation of existing parameters coding for substrate conversion kinetics and microbial growth.},

@article{Borch2010,
abstract = {Life and element cycling on Earth is directly related to electron transfer (or redox) reactions. An understanding of biogeochemical redox processes is crucial for predicting and protecting environmental health and can provide new opportunities for engineered remediation strategies. Energy can be released and stored by means of redox reactions via the oxidation of labile organic carbon or inorganic compounds (electron donors) by microorganisms coupled to the reduction of electron acceptors including humic substances, iron-bearing minerals, transition metals, metalloids, and actinides. Environmental redox processes play key roles in the formation and dissolution of mineral phases. Redox cycling of naturally occurring trace elements and their host minerals often controls the release or sequestration of inorganic contaminants. Redox processes control the chemical speciation, bioavailability, toxicity, and mobility of many major and trace elements including Fe, Mn, C, P, N, S, Cr, Cu, Co, As, Sb, Se, Hg, Tc, and U. Redox-active humic substances and mineral surfaces can catalyze the redox transformation and degradation of organic contaminants. In this review article, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of biogeochemical redox processes and their impact on contaminant fate and transport, including future research needs.},

abstract = {Beach sediment and sand are recognized as nonpoint fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) sources capable of causing water quality and health risks for beach-goers. A comprehensive understanding of the key factors and mechanisms governing the migration and exchange of FIB between beach water column and sediment is desired to better predict FIB concentration variations and assess the associated risk. The transport and retention behavior of two model FIB Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was examined using packed-bed columns in both saturated and unsaturated porous media to evaluate FIB migration potentials at conditions simulating the coastal aquatic environment. Additionally, complementary cell characterization techniques were conducted to better understand the migration behaviors of both FIB strains observed in the column experiments. The mobility of the gram-positive species E. faecalis was much more sensitive to solution chemistry and column saturation level than that of the gram-negative species E. coli. Interaction energy calculations suggest that E. faecalis retention was largely governed by the combination of DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) and non-DLVO (most likely hydrophobic and/or polymer bridging) interactions in saturated porous media, while the combination of DLVO and steric interactions controlled the deposition of E. coli cells. The measured surface properties of the two FIB strains supported the distinct bacteria transport behaviors and the differences of the identified mechanisms for each strain. As a result, E. faecalis showed the least affinity to sand in freshwater and appeared to be irreversibly attached in primary energy minima at elevated salt conditions; whereas the retained E. coli cells were reversibly attached and mostly associated with the secondary energy minima at both freshwater and seawater conditions. In unsaturated porous media, E. faecalis cells seemed to prefer to attachment at air/water interface rather than sand surface, while E. coli showed a similar affinity to the two interfaces. It was proposed that the different surface characteristics of the two FIB strains resulted in the distinct transport and retention behavior in porous media. These results highlight the need for FIB management to consider variations in transport behavior between model FIB when assessing water quality and associated risks.},

@article{Dechesne2008,
abstract = {Water is arguably the most important constituent of microbial microhabitats due to its control of physical and physiological processes critical to microbial activity. In natural environments, bacteria often live on unsaturated surfaces, in thin (micrometric) liquid films. Nevertheless, no experimental systems are available that allow real-time observation of bacterial processes in liquid films of controlled thickness. We propose a novel, inexpensive, easily operated experimental platform, termed the porous surface model (PSM) that enables quantitative real-time microscopic observations of bacterial growth and activity under controlled unsaturated conditions. Bacteria are inoculated on a porous ceramic plate, wetted by a liquid medium. The thickness of the liquid film at the surface of the plate is set by imposing suction, corresponding to soil matric potential, to the liquid medium. The utility of the PSM was demonstrated using Pseudomonas putida KT2440 tagged with gfp as a model bacterium. Single cells were inoculated at the surface of the PSM, and the rate at which colonies expanded laterally was measured for three matric potentials (-0.5, -1.2, and -3.6 kPa). The matric potential exerted significant influence on colony expansion rates, with a faster rate of spreading at -0.5 than at -1.2 or -3.6 kPa (diameter increase rate, ca. 1,000, 200, and 17 microm h(-1), respectively). These differences can be attributed to cell motility, strongly limited under the most negative matric potential. The PSM constitutes a tool uniquely adapted to study the influence of liquid film geometry on microbial processes. It should therefore contribute to uncovering mechanisms of microbial adaptation to unsaturated environments.},

Cells growing at dilution rates of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.6h-1 were able to immediately utilize and grow with fructose, mannose, maltose and ribose. Galactose was transported instantaneously but growth started only after a considerable lag. Arabinose was the only sugar tested which was neither transported nor utilized immediately. The results give experimental evidence that in vivo catabolite repression by glucose is absent at the very low glucose concentrations present in chemostat culture. Additionally, the results demonstrate that chemostat-grown cells of E. coli are able to substitute glucose as a carbon and energy source by several other sugars with no lag period.},

Three sand-filled plots were tested in three phases (each phase lasting approximately 2 weeks). During the control phase, toluene was applied uniformly via sprinkler irrigation. Passive remediation was allowed to occur during this phase. A modified Hoagland nutrient solution, concentrated in 150 L of water, was tested during the second phase. The final phase involved addition of 230 moles of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> in 150 L of water to increase the available oxygen needed for aerobic biodegradation.<P></P>During the first phase, measured toluene concentrations in soil gas were reduced from 120 ppm to 25 ppm in 14 days. After the addition of nutrients during the second phase, concentrations were reduced from 90 ppm to about 8 ppm within 14 days, and for the third phase (H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>), toluene concentrations were about 1 ppm after only 5 days. Initial results suggest that this method could be an effective means of remediating a contaminated site, directly after a BTEX spill, without the intrusiveness and high cost of other abatement technologies such as bioventing or soil-vapor extraction. However, further tests need to be completed to determine the effect of each of the BTEX components.",

abstract = {Retention of bacterial cells as "particles" by silica sand during formation of a capillary fringe (CF) and the influence of motility was examined with motile Pseudomonas putida and non-motile Corynebacterium glutamicum suspensions in the absence of nutrients. The fractional retention of C. glutamicum cells at all regions of the CF was higher than for P. putida cells, most probably due to the motility of P. putida. Only about 5\% of P. putida cells and almost no C. glutamicum cells reached the upper end of a CF of 10 cm height. With cell suspensions of P. putida and C. glutamicum in nutrient broth the development of a CF in silica sand fractions of 355-710 microm and 710-1000 microm respectively, was finished after about 6 h. Growth of cells proceeded for about 6 days. P. putida formed a biofilm on silica grains, whereas no attachment of C. glutamicum on silica sand occurred. Relative cell densities of C. glutamicum on the bottom and in the upper regions of the CF were always lower than those of P. putida and were also lower than those reached in suspended cultures with the same medium. In coarse sand the motile P. putida cells reached significantly higher cell densities in upper CF regions than in fine sand. Growth of C. glutamicum in the CF apparently was slower and a higher proportion of the energy was required for maintenance. Whereas cell densities of P. putida, in CFs of both sand fractions, varied less than one order of magnitude, those of C. glutamicum varied in a wider range from the basis to the top of the CF. Analyses of the esterase activity of P. putida and C. glutamicum with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) revealed that the cells in higher CF regions were significantly more active than those at the bottom of the CF. Furthermore, a significant correlation (r = 0.66, p < 0.01) between cells ml(-1) and the FDA conversion to fluorescein was found.},

abstract = {Mass transfer, mixing, and therefore reaction rates during transport of solutes in porous media strongly depend on dispersion and diffusion. In particular, transverse mixing is a significant mechanism controlling natural attenuation of contaminant plumes in groundwater. The aim of the present study is to gain a deeper understanding of vertical transverse dispersive mixing of reaction partners in saturated porous media. Multitracer laboratory experiments in a quasi two-dimensional tank filled with glass beads were conducted and transverse dispersion coefficients were determined from high-resolution vertical concentration profiles. We investigated the behavior of conservative tracers (i.e., fluorescein, dissolved oxygen, and bromide), with different aqueous diffusion coefficients, in a range of grain-related Peclet numbers between 1 and 562. The experimental results do not agree with the classical linear parametric model of hydrodynamic dispersion, in which the transverse component is approximated as the sum of pore diffusion and a compound-independent mechanical dispersion term. The outcome of the multitracer experiments clearly indicates a nonlinear relation between the dispersion coefficient and the average linear velocity. More importantly, we show that transverse mechanical dispersion depends on the diffusion coefficient of the compound, at least at the experimental bench-scale. This result has to be considered in reactive-transport models, because the typical assumption that two reactants with different aqueous diffusive properties are characterized by the same dispersive behavior does not hold anymore.},

The sediments comprised 0.18-0.50mm quartz sand, grains coated with goethite, calcite grains or grains of activated carbon (AC), in varying fractions (lambda=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0) and all of similar diameter to the quartz sand. The weighted sum of favourable and unfavourable sticking efficiencies (alpha(total)) showed that upon increasing the fraction of favourable mineral grains (lambda) there was an initial rapid increase, which then slowed down. This was most pronounced in the AC experiments, followed by the calcite experiments and then the goethite experiments. We ascribe this non-linear relation to surface charge and hydrophobic heterogeneity of the E. coli population.},

abstract = {Oxygen transport across the capillary fringe is relevant for many biogeochemical processes. We present a non-invasive technique, based on optode technology, to measure high-resolution concentration profiles of oxygen across the unsaturated/saturated interface. By conducting a series of quasi two-dimensional flow-through laboratory experiments, we show that vertical hydrodynamic dispersion in the water-saturated part of the capillary fringe is the process limiting the mass transfer of oxygen. A number of experimental conditions were tested in order to investigate the influence of grain size and horizontal flow velocity on transverse vertical dispersion in the capillary fringe. In the same setup, analogous experiments were simultaneously carried out in the fully water-saturated zone, therefore allowing a direct comparison with oxygen transfer across the capillary fringe. The outcomes of the experiments under various conditions show that oxygen transport in the two zones of interest (i.e., the unsaturated/saturated interface and the saturated zone) is characterized by very similar transverse dispersion coefficients. An influence of the capillary fringe morphology on oxygen transport has not been observed. These results may be explained by the narrow grain size distribution used in the experiments, leading to a steep decline in water saturation at the unsaturated/saturated interface and to the absence of trapped gas in this transition zone. We also modeled flow (applying the van Genuchten and the Brooks-Corey relationships) and two-dimensional transport across the capillary fringe, obtaining simulated profiles of equivalent aqueous oxygen concentration that were in good agreement with the observations.},

        abstract = {This book introduces the basic ideas for building discontinuous Galerkin
methods and, at the same time, incorporates several recent mathematical
developments. It is to a large extent self-contained and is intended for
graduate students and researchers in numerical analysis. The material
covers a wide range of model problems, both steady and unsteady,
elaborating from advection-reaction and diffusion problems up to the
Navier-Stokes equations and Friedrichs' systems. Both finite-element and
finite-volume viewpoints are utilized to convey the main ideas underlying
the design of the approximation. The analysis is presented in a rigorous
mathematical setting where discrete counterparts of the key properties of
the continuous problem are identified. The framework encompasses fairly
general meshes regarding element shapes and hanging nodes. Salient
implementation issues are also addressed.}
